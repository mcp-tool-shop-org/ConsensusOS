# ConsensusOS

## What This Does (Prototype)

⚠️ **Prototype Status** — Early-stage exploration of decentralized consensus mechanisms.

Explores distributed consensus algorithms and Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems
for multi-agent coordination and agreement protocols.

## Architecture

- Consensus algorithm implementations (Raft, PBFT variants)
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance analysis
- Multi-node simulation and testing
- Protocol verification tools

## Key Notes

- Early-stage research/exploration
- Not production-ready
- API subject to change
- See README for current phase and roadmap
