# ConsensusOS Modular Doctrine

ConsensusOS is a modular control plane safeguarding distributed consensus systems.

## Principles
1. Core must remain minimal.
2. All functionality is modular.
3. Deterministic state transitions only.
4. Fail-closed invariant enforcement.
5. Chain logic isolated in adapters.
6. Simulation isolated from production.
7. Reproducibility over convenience.
8. Governance is first-class.
