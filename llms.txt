# ConsensusOS

> Modular, zero-dependency control plane for multi-chain consensus governance

## Overview

ConsensusOS is a plugin-based control plane for governing multi-chain infrastructure. The core is deliberately thin — all functionality lives in plugins that communicate through a shared event bus. Governance rules are enforced by a fail-closed invariant engine. Zero production dependencies.

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/ConsensusOS.git
cd ConsensusOS
npm install
npm test    # 295 tests passing
```

## Architecture

```
CLI (entry point)
├── Plugin SDK / Attestation
├── Health Sentinel | Verifier | Config Guardian | Sandbox
├── Governor Layer (Token, Policy, Queue)
├── Adapters (XRPL / Ethereum / Cosmos)
└── Core: EventBus, InvariantEngine, Loader, Logger
    └── Plugin API v1 (frozen)
```

## Key Modules

- **Health Sentinel** — Node health monitoring via heartbeats
- **Release Verifier** — Software release hash verification
- **Config Guardian** — Configuration schema validation
- **Sandbox Engine** — Isolated simulation, deterministic replay, amendments
- **Governor** — Token-based execution limits, policy enforcement, build queue

## Chain Adapters

- XRPL — Implemented
- Ethereum — Implemented
- Cosmos — Implemented

## Constraints

- Zero production dependencies (no npm packages in production)
- Plugin API v1 is frozen — breaking changes are not permitted
- Fail-closed: invalid state transitions are always rejected
- All state is deterministically replayable from event history
- Resource-bounded execution: CPU, memory, and time limits enforced via tokens

## Test Suites

```
npm test         # Full suite (295 tests)
npx vitest       # Watch mode
```
